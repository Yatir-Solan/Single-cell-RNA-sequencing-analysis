# Single-cell-RNA-sequencing-analysis
In order to learn scRNAseq analysis, I decided to reconstruct a Nature paper using Python's Scanpy package. The paper examined lung cells from multiple COVID-19 patients to construct a comprehensive cellular atlas. The project is still ongoing, and I welcome any questions, tips, critiques, or suggestions that could help me enhance my skills.
